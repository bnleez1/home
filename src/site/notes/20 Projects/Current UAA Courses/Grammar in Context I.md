# Course Description
This practical subject focuses on developing the student's ability to use the grammatical structures of the English language according to context, promoting their communication skills. This subject runs concurrently with Listening and Speaking II, Reading II, Writing II and Integration of Skills through Culture II, and precedes all the subjects from first semester of the major. It also supports the subjects in the area of Development of Skills for Communication in English.
# Course Objective
By the end of the course, the student will apply various grammatical structures of the English language according to the context to communicating effectively at a B1+ level of the CEFR with an attitude towards continuous learning, being proactive and positive.
# Methodology
The course methodology will be student-centered, as well as problem-solving, projects, and everyday situations in the English language in different authentic contexts. Students will be able to experience and reproduce the English language through authentic oral and written texts. These come from audios, videos, and readings (e.g., informal conversations, news, lectures, song lyrics, etc.) which they will review in individual, pair, or team work. The teacher's main role will be that of facilitator, while the student will be an active and responsible participant in their learning process. During the course, the development of learning strategies will be promoted through techniques  
such as debates, conversations, discussions, playful activities, analysis of texts and audios, using a variety of interactions, authentic materials, and ICTs.
