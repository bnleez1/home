# Course Description
This is a practical course which focuses on improving students‚Äô English language abilities in listening, speaking, reading and writing, vocabulary and grammar, as well as the use of cultural aspects from a communicative perspective at a B1+ level of the CEFR. Through the course content and learning experiences, this course contributes to the Institutional Program for Humanist Formation and its partial accreditation. It is the first course under the curricular area of Development of Communicative Abilities in English and it precedes Communicative Abilities in English 2, Teaching Workshop 1, 2, and 3, Academic Writing. This course also supports the curricular areas of Applied Linguistics, Teaching Practicum, and English Language Teaching Methodologies.
# Course Objective
At the end of the course, students will have developed their English language skills to communicate effectively at a B1+ level of the CEFR, with quality, autonomy, and an openness to feedback.
# Methodology
The course's methodology will adopt a forward-thinking, learner-focused strategy, acknowledging that individuals perceive, engage with, and demonstrate understanding in diverse ways. Instruction will be designed from the outset to cater to varied needs, interests, and levels of preparedness. The course prioritizes establishing clear learning objectives and defining acceptable evidence of proficiency _before_ planning learning experiences. All language practice will be exclusively in English, utilizing diverse individual, pair, and group activities. Technology will be leveraged for accessibility and to deliver multimodal resources. Continuous, mastery-focused feedback, including self- and peer-assessment, will guide student progress and reflection, with the instructor serving a supportive role.
# Assessment
## **Portfolio of Class work** (Traditional or E-Portfolio) - **30%**
- Includes exercises, activities, tasks, assignments, discussions, and presentations
- Graded once every four weeks (late assignments will receive a zero grade)
## **Midterm project - 35%**
- **üóπ Part A:** A 10-minute video presentation on any combination of topics from Unit I. Creativity, fluency, pronunciation, cohesion, and use of language will be evaluated.
- **üóπ Part B:**¬† Expository Essay (5 paragraphs) on any combination of topics from Unit I: Introduction, supporting details, conclusion, organization, cohesion, coherence, use of English, and APA will be evaluated.
## **‚¶ø¬† Final project - 35%**

## **Notes**
1. APA style will be required for all written assignments.
2. According to the ELT policy, if a student commits plagiarism, the student will receive a zero grade for the assignment. Also, written texts are expected to have an originality score between 90%-100% to receive full credit for the assignment. Using translation software, grammar checkers like Microsoft Editor, and any other forms of generative AI will decrease one‚Äôs originality score.
3. To receive full credit, graded assignments **MUST** be completed and turned in on time according to the established due dates. Late assignments will receive a zero grade.
4. The instructor will give specific guidelines for the development of the different class assignments and projects.
5. 80% of attendance will be required to pass this course. Attendance will be taken per session.
6. The instructor will upload partial grades to E-SIIMA as a reference of specific assessment progress. The final grade will not correspond to the average of the uploaded grades.
