# Course Description
This is a theoretical and practical course that provides knowledge related to the study of language as a social phenomenon, with variants of the English language and factors that influence its use. In this course, students will have the opportunity to engage with the search and processing of information. Through the content and learning experiences of this course, students will contribute to the objectives of the Institutional Humanist Training Program and its partial accreditation. This course is preceded by the Introduction to Linguistics and Morphology course, and is a precursor to the courses in Psycholinguistics, Discourse Analysis, Applied Linguistics, and the Integration Seminar.
# Course Objective
At the end of the course, students will analyze the variations and functions of the English language in different social contexts and their relevance to teaching English in a reflective and pluralistic manner.
  
# Methodology
This course employs dynamic presentations to cultivate a student-centered learning environment focused on building critical thinking, reading, and reflective skills. The pedagogical approach facilitates lively interaction around core sociolinguistic content and practical activities through various formats, including individual work, pair work, small group activities, and whole-group discussions. The instructor's role is to facilitate this engagement by enabling learners to actively analyze the variations and functions of the English language in different social contexts and understand language as a social phenomenon from both a learner and language educator perspective. This interactive process is supported by applying various teaching materials designed to foster collaboration and deeper engagement with the course's theoretical and practical dimensions.
